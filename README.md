# LoL Champion Card Tournament Style<br>![MIT License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)
  ## Description
  This application allows you to generate a deck of champions for a player to use in a tournament. A deck will be drawn from a list of champions based on deck type and rarity, then that player is restricted to using only those champions. As they defeat other players, they obtain their champion cards or lose their own if they are defeated.
